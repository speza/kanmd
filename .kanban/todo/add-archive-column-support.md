# Add archive column support

## Description
Support archiving completed cards to keep the done column clean. Could be a configurable archive column or a separate archive command that moves cards out of the active board view.

## Checklist
- [ ] Design archive behavior (separate dir vs hidden column)
- [ ] Add archive command or auto-archive option
- [ ] Add unarchive capability
- [ ] Update board display to optionally show archived
